# Memoization in Ruby

Running the samples requires a recent [Ruby version](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
You may run all examples directly via

```sh
ruby <example.rb>
```

except for `safe_double_checked_locking.rb` which requires the
[concurrent-ruby gem](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby).
If you have Bundler installed (`gem install bundler`), you may run the file via

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec ruby safe_double_checked_locking.rb
```
